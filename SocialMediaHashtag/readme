This README provides an overview, installation instructions, AWS setup details, and guidance on running the application.
This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to compose and publish posts containing text and hashtags. 
The posts are processed using AWS Lambda and stored in DynamoDB. 
The application also identifies and displays trending hashtags in real-time.

## Features

- Compose and publish posts with text and hashtags
- Store posts in DynamoDB via AWS Lambda
- Analyze DynamoDB to identify trending hashtags
- Display trending hashtags in real-time

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- AWS account with access to Lambda and DynamoDB

 AWS Setup

1. **Create a DynamoDB table:**

    - Table name: `your-dynamodb-table-name`
    - Primary key: `post_id` (String)
    - Sort key: `timestamp` (String)

2. **Create  2 AWS Lambda functions:**

    - **Post Processing Lambda:**
      - Name: `your-lambda-function-name`
      - Runtime: Python 3.x
      - Handler: `lambda_function.lambda_handler`
      - Code:

     **Trending Hashtags Lambda:**
      - Name: `your-trending-hashtags-lambda-function-name`
      - Runtime: Python 3.x
      - Handler: `lambda_function.lambda_handler`

3. Download the python file "socialmediahashtag.py" and change the relevant dynamodb table and the lamda functions in the python code.

4. Run the python file with the Streamlit path.
